# Student Management System

A **dynamic database project** that seamlessly connects the front-end with the back-end to manage student records. This project demonstrates full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality in a web environment and is built using modern Java technologies.

## Overview

The **Student Management System** is a robust, full-stack application that:
- **Stores and manages student records** (name, email, course, etc.).
- Provides an interactive, responsive **frontend (JSP)** for data entry and display.
- Leverages **Servlets and JDBC** for dynamic interaction with a **MySQL database**.
- Runs on **Apache Tomcat 11** and is developed with Jakarta EE standards.
- Serves as a proof-of-concept for creating your own dynamic database-driven application connecting both frontend and backend seamlessly.

> **Note:** A video demonstration of the working model is available in the repository!

## Features
